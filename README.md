# 2D-FPCB-scanner-interactive-projector
This project uses a Teensy 3.6 microcontroller to read and process data from two 2D FPCB laser scanners and sends the data through serial communication to a desktop computer where python code is used to post-process. This is for the use of an interactive projector
